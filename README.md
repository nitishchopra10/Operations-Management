 ## Basic Project Architecture
 ![Basic Architecture](https://tusharsharma118.github.io/Hosted-Images/OPM.png)
 ***

 
### To run the project:
  #### Must Create the DB(opr_mgmt) and schema(opm) inside postgresql first before running the services!!!
  (Project runs on Angular CLI version 1.6.1)
  For the UI, to install node modules(from inside the directory)
  > npm install
#### for hosting the UI
  > ng serve --port 4100
***

## For Microservices
  
#### In Eclipse
 ## To load dummy data change file name in TDM resources to import.sql from DummyData.sql and change the hibernate-ddl to create-drop.
 1. Maven -> build (to generate target files and Mapper)[Skip tests if they cause the buid to fail] 
  > clean install 
 2. Launch services in order
  > Discovery -> followed by rest of the services as required -> lastly Gateway
 
 ***
 Hit the url
 >  http://localhost:8765/oprmgmt/authenticate/register
 #### With the json object
 > {
        "username": "test1",
        "password": "test1"   }
   
 #### this creates a user to use the ui and backend. This will be linked to the UI in the next iteration
